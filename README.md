# java-cli-bazel-cockroachdb-single-node-without-ssl-recurcive-cte

## Description
Creates a small database table
called `dog`. This table, `dog`, has been normalized to 3NF.
Two new tables have been added, `breedLookup` and `colorLookup`.
Creates a new table `dog_expanded` that joins
`dog`, `breedLookup` and `colorLookup`.

Turned `dog_expanded` into a view with an
implicit index on `dog_expanded`.id. Using the aggregate function
COUNT, create a new view `breed_count` using recurcive common table expression.

All output normally
seen in a terminal will be in `log` which will dump to the screen. The project may seem to hang but the logs from the container must be written to the project this can take up to 3 min.

A java bazel build, that connects to single node
cockroach database without ssl.
